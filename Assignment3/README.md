## Tips By Lao_JK For Test1-3
    First lots of thanks for everybody who contribute to this repo :D  
    And for the users, please remember these tests will probably NOT cover all situation!

Please note that all of them have different map size, **the test1 is suitable for debugging**!  
And a reminder, I did NOT write enough case to test the function __is_valid_path__ when the path is not vaild!  
For other functions, I tried my best to cover all the cases, but still, **it is not a guarantee**. Do write your own test cases and welcome to contribute!  
Finally don't forget to test your program using [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) to make sure you can pass the memory check.

Good Luck :)
